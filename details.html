                <h1>Cleveland Clinic Article</h1>
                <p>This article has tons of detailed information, but keep in mind some is more
                    extreme than what normally occurs. Though endometriosis can expand into 
                    something much worse, in many cases women suffer with tinier symptoms without 
                    knowing it falls under this condition.
                <br/>
                <p>
                    Endometriosis is a long-term, inflammatory condition that can progress over
                    time and vary widely in severity, sometimes worsening without consistent
                    management. The article emphasizes that the condition is often underdiagnosed
                    or diagnosed years after symptoms begin, partly because definitive diagnosis 
                    usually requires a laparoscopic surgical procedure, not just imaging or 
                    exams. Endometriosis can also lead to complications such as scar tissue 
                    (adhesions), organ distortion, and infertility, depending on where the 
                    tissue grows. While there is no cure, treatment focuses on managing 
                    inflammation, slowing disease progression, and preserving quality of 
                    life, and care often needs to be individualized and adjusted over time 
                    as symptoms and life goals (like fertility) change.</p>

                <h1>World Health Organization (WHO)</h1>
                <p>Endometriosis is a chronic disease affecting about 10% of
                    people of reproductive age worldwide (around 190 million), in
                    which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the
                    uterus, causing inflammation, scar tissue, and a wide range of symptoms
                    such as severe menstrual pain, chronic pelvic pain, heavy bleeding,
                    pain during intercourse, bowel or urinary discomfort, bloating, nausea,
                    fatigue, and troubles with fertility. <br> <br> It can occur inside and, in rare
                    cases, outside the pelvis, and while there’s no known cure or way to
                    prevent it, treatments—including pain medication, hormonal therapies, and
                    surgery—focus on managing symptoms and improving quality of life.
                    Diagnosis is often delayed due to variable symptoms and limited awareness,
                    especially in many countries with fewer healthcare resources. <br> <br>
                    Endometriosis also has significant social, economic, and mental health
                    impacts, and improving early diagnosis, care access, and awareness is a
                    global health priority.</p>
