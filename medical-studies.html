                <h1>The Importance</h1>
                <p>Struggling with endometriosis is challenging, especailly when there is little
                    to no solution available. Research studies, clinical trials, articles, videos,
                    have all shed little light on this condition, but there is still a long way to go.
                    Female health research is extremely bare, often overlooked, underfunded, and this 
                    needs to change.
                    <br><br>
                    Women should not feel neglected by doctors and society, and we
                    need to be heard. The more we educate ourselves and the more we speak up, the more
                    the research community will pay attention. Female health must improve, and we can start 
                    here. I encourage you to research on your own, share this website, post about this,
                    and never shy away from conversations that may seem "uncomfortable" at first.
                    <br><br>
                    If you've made it this far, I appreciate your time. Feel free to reach out if you have
                    any questions or need support.
